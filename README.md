## Robot localization and Bayesian filtering project deliverables:

- Bayes filter for binary sensor vacuum cleaning robot
- generating N samples from cumulative distribution function
- localize robot moving in planar environment with identifiable landmarks using non-linear landmark-based localization via Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter
